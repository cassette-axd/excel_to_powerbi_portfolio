# Marketing Dashboard

## Objective
### To support effective marketing campaigns by identifying and tracking the top-performing UK YouTubers using key performance indicators such as subscribers, video uploads, and total views.

## Challenges
### The BI Reporting team faced significant hurdles in acquiring accurate and comprehensive YouTube data from third-party sources. This created gaps in insight and hindered campaign planning.

## Solution
### Developed a unified dashboard that integrates data from Excel, SQL, and Python into Power BI to deliver a clean, interactive visualization of:

Top UK YouTubers by subscriber count

Most active creators by video uploads

Channels with the highest total views

This tool empowers marketing teams to make data-driven decisions when selecting YouTubers for brand partnerships.
